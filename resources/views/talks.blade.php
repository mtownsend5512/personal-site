		</p>
		<p>
			I spoke in front of a crowd of Laracon attendees about a hobby-project I created, <a target="_blank" href="http://dyinghorizon.com/">Dying Horizon</a>. The talk featured the flexibility of the Laravel framework while showcasing some of my creativity in crafting a text & image based multiplayer game. I featured some helpful development tips that the audience could implement in their own Laravel projects.
